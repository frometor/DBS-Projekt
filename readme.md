This Project was done during the Database Systems Projekt at Freie Universit√§t Berlin in summer 2015.

# Prerequisites
For the project we used:
* a PostgreSQL database named movies (SQL create statments included)
* jdbc for PostgreSQL to connect to the database which we downloaded from here: (https://jdbc.postgresql.org)
* a self developed API named dbs.jar 
  * located inside dbsProjekt/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib 
  * or you can see the *.java files inside the DBS_API folder 
* Apache Tomcat together with Java Serverpages for displaying the content 
* HTML & CSS together with Twitter Bootstrap for a better GUI
 
I did not attached the imdb_top100k.csv because I don't want to infringe any copyrights.
